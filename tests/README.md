# TESTS
In golang the form that you write a test is simple. You just need create a file with final prefix _test.
After you have to implement the test with "testing" package. 

Example [here](tests_test.go)

Now you just have to put on the terminal:
```shell
 $ go test
```
and all the tests will be read and executed.
